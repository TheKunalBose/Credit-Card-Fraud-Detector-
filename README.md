## 📌 Project Summary

The **Credit Card Fraud Detector** is a Python-based program that predicts whether a customer's credit card payment is safe or potentially fraudulent. This tool is designed to assist users in making safer online payments by analyzing the behavior of the transaction.

---

## 🔍 Context

With the rise of online shopping, ensuring the safety of credit card transactions has become increasingly important. Many users struggle to determine whether a website or payment portal is trustworthy.

To help solve this issue, this project aims to offer a quick and intelligent way to check the safety of online payment platforms using machine learning.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The fraud detector uses a **Decision Tree** machine learning algorithm to predict whether a transaction is safe or fraudulent.
- It is trained on a dataset of over **25,000** transaction records sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a popular data science platform.
- The program is developed using **Python** and leverages statistical data to identify patterns of fraud.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Scikit-learn** (for Decision Tree model)
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** (for data handling)
- **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn** (optional, for visualization)

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Contains over **25,000 rows** of credit card transaction data
- Includes labeled data indicating whether a transaction is safe or fraudulent

---

## ✅ Key Features

- Predicts the safety of a credit card transaction
- Uses real-world data for training
- Simple and beginner-friendly interface (can be expanded into GUI or web-based tool in the future)

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
- Improve model accuracy using more complex algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Include more features in the dataset
